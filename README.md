A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

## Assets

include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
